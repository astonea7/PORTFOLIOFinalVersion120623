			<p>Hi! My name is Alyssa Stone! I go to school at the University of Pittsburgh and I expect to graduate in April 2024.
			Through the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, I am majoring in Communication & Rhetoric and minoring in English Literature.
			I am also getting a Digital Media certificate through the College of General Studies. Outside of academics, I am the Executive Chair
			for the club EMPOWER, which focuses on uplifting women in the Pittsburgh community. In addition, I am currently working as a Hostess 
			at Duoâ€™s Taqueria in Pittsburgh, PA and have been since August 2023. This is not yet on my resume as it is very recent.</p>
			<p>Speaking of which, my resume can be found below, however; if you really want to get to know me, check out my Interests!</p>
