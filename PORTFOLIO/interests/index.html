			<h2>Music</h2>

			<p>I think my connection to music has been there from the start. I started playing
				instruments at a young age. Going from the recorder in 3rd grade, 
				to the clarinet in 4th grade, and then onto the alto saxophone in
				5th grade, I enjoyed getting to know more and more instruments. 
				I stuck with the saxophone for 6 years and only stopped playing due to time 
				constraints brought on by school. If I was able to afford a saxophone 
				of my own and private lessons, I would definitely resume playing. During 
				my years as a budding musician, I had the honor of getting to interact 
				and play with many amazing people. I worked with renowned musicians such as 
				Virigina Mayhew, Oscar Perez, Kelly Green, Bruce Williams, and more. I performed 
				for the Nikil Badlani Foundation annually and also took part in concerts put on 
				by Jazz House Kids. Although I stopped playing in bands around 2020, that did not
				dim my love for music. I registered up for my first Spotify account during 
				8th grade in 2016 and I have been a loyal user ever since. Music is apart of my daily
				life and I want to keep it that way as I search for a career.</p>

			<h2>Editing</h2>

			<p>Something I have always been intrigued by is video editing. Being able to use clips from
			movies, shows, and other media forms and pairing it together with the right audio to bring a
			new representation to life is something I admired. I wanted the ability to make my imagination
			a reality and editing seemed to be a way to do just that. I mostly found edits I liked to watch
			on social media, and this is where I reached out to an editor I loved and became their apprentice.
			With the Sony Vegas Pro 14 software they recommended and excitement to begin my journey, I taught
			myself how to make the edits I loved to watch. It was very challenging in the beginning and I gave
			up trying at times, but I came back to the program and kept on playing around with the features until
			things clicked. Once that occurred, I went from making slideshows with music on my phone to full blown
			official software edits which was a feat I only dreamed of reaching. Since anime is a genre of media I
			thoroughly enjoy, I made multiple anime edits and posted them on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sin-seiga">Youtube</a> 
			channel which I am very proud of!</p>

			<h2>Social Media</h2>

			<p>I have been using social media since at least middle school, if not sooner. Being Generation Z, It has
			been a part of my life and I definitely embraced it. As mentioned before, I really love anime and sharing my
			interests with others, especially like minded individuals. Around 2015 or 2016, I created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sin.saiga/">Instagram</a> account
			in order to have a place to post about a show I really liked at the time. It was never something I took seriously,
			more just a passion project to pass the time and find people who also enjoyed the show as much as me. In 2018, I
			began consistently posting content about the show and the account quickly gained traction in the community. By the
			end of 2019, I had received over 150,000 likes on the account and at its peak, I had over 3,000 followers. The story
			and production of the show dropped significantly in quality which led me to no longer being a fan and ultimately not
			keeping up with the account anymore, however; for the time that I did have and actively used it, I hit major milestones
			and learned social media skills I could possibly use in a career setting.</p>
