# PORTFOLIOFinalVersion120623

I had to delete all the old files I had because they weren't in the proper folders and my site would have been unusable that way. Thanks to the help of a classmate, I learned how to upload entire folders and everything in them so that everything stays together in the intended way! So I am now reuploading all of this to make it more cohesive (12/10/23)
